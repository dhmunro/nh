  <h2>Section 3.1.  The Navigation Methodology</h2>

  <p>Consider first the general problem of determining the location of
    a spacecraft which makes nearly simultaneous measurements of the
    unit direction vectors $\bh{d}_k$ to $N$ stars.  If we also have
    the SSB-based position vectors $\bv{p}_k$ of those stars derived
    from the Gaia DR3 catalog, then each direction measurement
    determines a line passing through $\bv{p}_k$ in direction
    $\bh{d}_k.$  The spacecraft position vector $\bv{x}$ must be
    the common intersection point of these $N$ lines.  Of course, in
    practice, no two of these lines will exactly meet, owing to
    measurement errors in the $\bh{d}_k$ or $\bv{p}_k.$  We want to
    find the most likely position $\bv{x}$ consistent with these
    measurement errors.</p>

  <p>Define $\bv{Q}_k=\bv{I}-\bh{d}_k\bh{d}_k^T$ to be the $3\times 3$
    projection matrix into the plane normal to $\bh{d}_k.$ Then
    \begin{equation} \bv{u}_k = \bv{Q}_k(\bv{x} - \bv{p}_k)
    \label{eq:udef}\end{equation}
    is the perpendicular displacement of any point $\bv{x}$ from the
    line determined by $\bh{d}_k$ and $\bv{p}_k.$ The length
    $u_k=|\bv{u}_k|$ is the impact parameter of the line as it passes
    $\bv{x}.$ If all the measurements were perfect, then all $N$ of
    the $\bv{u}_k$ would be exactly zero, giving us an overdetermined
    system of $3N$ equations for the three components of $\bv{x}.$
    (Note, however, that since each $\bv{Q}_k$ is a projection into a
    plane, only $2N$ of these equations are linearly independent, so
    we need $N\ge 2$ to solve for $\bv{x}.$)</p>

  <p>One very easy and symmetric way to solve for $\bv{x}$ is to
    simply sum the $\bv{u}_k=0$ equations to get the
    $\sum_k\bv{u}_k=0,$ which is a $3\times 3$ system of equations for
    $\bv{x}.$ It turns out that solving this system gives the position
    $\bv{x}$ with minimum RMS distance to the $N$ lines (hence the
    common intersection point if all $N$ actually do meet).  However,
    we wouldn't usually judge this to be the most <em>likely</em>
    position $\bv{x}$ because our measurement errors will usually
    constrain $\bv{x}$ to lie closer to some lines than to others.  In
    order to find the most likely $\bv{x},$ we instead want to minimize
    \begin{equation} \chi^2 = \sum_k \bv{u}_k^T\BL(\bv{u}_k)\bv{u}_k,
    \label{eq:chi2}\end{equation}
    where $\BL(\bv{u}_k)$ is the inverse covariance matrix
    characterizing our measurement errors (see any text on data
    modeling[Numerical Recipes sec. 15.4]), and we assume that the
    errors in the $N$ lines are statistically independent of one
    another.</p>

  <p>To estimate the error in extracting the direction of a star from a
    particular LORRI image is not easy, and the error will certainly
    vary from image to image depending on the exact circumstances of
    spacecraft residual slew rates, exposure times, the background
    star field, and many other factors.  Many of these factors will
    not be known until after the image has been made, so for the
    purposes of planning a set of observations, a reasonable
    assumption is that the error in $\bh{d}_k$ is simply some angle
    $\sigma_d$ on the sky.  For a star at distance $p_k=|\bv{p}_k|$
    this angular error will cause the line determined by $\bh{d}_k$
    and $\bv{p}_k$ to be displaced by $p_k\sigma_d$.  In other words,
    the standard deviation in either component of $\bv{u}_k$ caused by
    our measurement error is $p_k\sigma_d,$ so that
    \begin{equation} \chi^2 = (1/\sigma_d^2)\sum_k|\bv{u}_k|^2/p_k^2,
    \label{eq:chi2a}\end{equation}
    For a single LORRI image, experience has shown us that $\sigma_d$
    is of order 200&nbsp;mas (1&nbsp;&micro;rad).  A single pixel is
    4080&nbsp;mas, so this amounts to a twentieth of a pixel.  Note
    that this is not a question of the resolution of the instrument,
    but of how well one statistic - the centroid - can be determined
    for something known to be a point source.  This is very much a
    ballpark estimate, within perhaps a factor of two or three.</p>

  <p>This $\chi^2$ is minimum when $\sum_k\bv{u}_k/p_k^2=0,$ or
    \begin{equation} \bv{x} =
        \bigl(\bv{V}(\bv{x})/\sigma_d^2\bigr)\sum_k\bv{Q}_k\bv{p}_k/p_k^2,
    \label{eq:x}\end{equation}
    where
    \begin{equation} \bv{V}(\bv{x}) = \sigma_d^2
        \bigl(\sum_k\bv{Q}_k/p_k^2\bigr)^{-1}
    \label{eq:xcov}\end{equation}
    is the covariance matrix for the errors we can expect in our
    solution $\bv{x}.$[Numerical Recipes sec. 15.4]  That is,
    we expect some components of $\bv{x}$ to be more accurately
    determined than others by the specific stars we choose, and this
    $\bv{V}(\bv{x})$ determines the associated error ellipsoid.</p>

  <p>Eq.($\ref{eq:x}$) matches the formulas given in Kaplan [2011],
    with the $1/p_k^2$ providing the weights for the terms in the sum.
    In particular, notice that if we had simply minimized
    $\chi^2=\sum_k|\bv{u}_k|^2,$ then Eq.($\ref{eq:x}$) would have
    been the simple $\sum_k\bv{u}_k=0$ solution mentioned above, which
    minimizes the RMS distance of $\bv{x}$ from all the lines.  For
    the $N=2$ case, notice that $\bv{x}$ will always lie on the line
    segment connecting the points of closest approach of the two
    lines, which is perpendicular to both lines.  (Projecting any
    point not on the connecting line onto it, will reduce $\chi^2$
    according to Eq.($\ref{eq:chi2a}$).)  In fact, $\bv{x}$ will
    lie at the point dividing that connecting line segment in the
    ratio $p_1^2:p_2^2,$ so that $\bv{x}$ will be closer to the line
    to the nearer star.</p>

  <p>Unlike the situation for $\bh{d}_k,$ the Gaia DR3 catalog
    provides extensive information about the detailed covariance
    matrix $\bv{V}(\bv{p}_k)$ associated with each star position.
    These errors are completely negligible compared to the LORRI
    errors.  However, if New Horizons were much farther away, or if it
    had a more accurate astrometry instrument, eventually the long
    baseline would make the spacecraft direction measurements
    competitive with Gaia for finding the distances to stars.  How
    much better would our measurements need to be for that to
    happen?</p>

  <p>Ignoring all of the detailed information for error covariances of
    individual stars in the Gaia catalog, we can treat the errors in
    the Gaia data in a manner roughly analogous to our estimate of the
    LORRI errors.  Thus, the Gaia error in angles on the sky are
    similar for most stars, with a standard deviation $\sigma_p$ of
    order 0.02&nbsp;mas (0.1&nbsp;nrad), while the errors in parallax
    $\sigma_\pi$ are a bit larger.  For high proper motion stars like
    Proxima Cen and Wolf 359, $\sigma_\pi$ is 0.05&nbsp;mas or
    somewhat more, and the error $\sigma_p$ in angle on the sky grows
    quite rapidly as the epoch moves away from the 2016 DR3 epoch.  In
    the 4.3 years from 2016.0 to our April 2020 observations,
    $\sigma_p$ has grown an order of magnitude, to roughly
    1&nbsp;nrad.</p>

  <p>Changing the direction $\bh{p}_k$ by $\sigma_p$ would change
    $\bv{u}_k$ by $p_k\sigma_p.$ Changing the parallax by $\sigma_\pi$
    causes a much larger error in the distance of $p_k\sigma_k/\pi,$
    but only the small component of this perpendicular to $\bh{d}_k$
    has any effect on $\bv{u}_k.$ Define
    $\bv{e}_k=e_k\bh{e}_k=\bv{Q}_k\bh{p}_k,$ so that $e_k$ is the
    small angle between the Gaia direction $\bh{p}_k$ and the measured
    direction $\bh{d}_k$ from New Horizons.  Then changing the parallax
    by $\sigma_\pi$ would change $\bv{u}_k$ by $p_ke_k\sigma_k/\pi$
    in the direction $\bh{e}_k$ on the sky.  Including the LORRI
    angular error $\sigma_d,$ the covariance matrix for $\bv{u}_k$
    is roughly
    \begin{equation} \bv{V}(\bv{u}_k) = p_k^2\bigl(\sigma_d^2\bv{Q}_k +
        \sigma_p^2\bv{Q}_k + (e_k\sigma_\pi/\pi)^2\bh{e}_k\bh{e}_k^T\bigr).
    \label{eq:ucov2}\end{equation}
    The $\BL(\bv{u}_k)$ for Eq.($\ref{eq:chi2}$) is the pseudo-inverse
    of this covariance $\bv{V}(\bv{u}_k),$ that is,
    $\BL(\bv{u}_k)\bv{V}(\bv{u}_k)=\bv{Q}_k.$ For our case,
    $e_k\sigma_\pi/\pi$ is of order 2&nbsp;mas (10&nbsp;nrad).  Hence,
    the ratio of the standard deviations
    $\sigma_d:\sigma_p:e_k\sigma_\pi/\pi$ in the three terms of
    Eq.($\ref{eq:ucov2}$) is roughly $1000:1:10.$  This justifies
    ignoring the Gaia terms earlier, and shows how much improvement
    in the direction measurements from the spacecraft would be
    required before the Gaia errors came into play.</p>

  <h2>Data</h2>

  <p>The NH observations consist of a total of twelve images, six of
    Proxima Cen split into two "visits" of three 0.5 s exposures, and
    six of Wolf 359, also split into two visits of 5 s exposures.
    The three images within each visit are separated by only seconds.
    The total elapsed time is 27.65 hours, during which time the
    spacecraft moved 0.0093 au (nearly 1.4 million km at 14 km/s).</p>
