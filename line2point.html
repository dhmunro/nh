  <h2>Section 3.1. The Navigation Methodology</h2>

  <p>Fig.(3) diagrams the basic geometry of interstellar navigation.
    We know with great precision the position vectors $\bv{p_k}$ of
    nearby stars in three dimensions from the Gaia DR3 archive.
    (We'll return to exactly how precise later.)  We measure the
    apparent directions to those stars - unit vectors $\bh{d}_k$ -
    from the vantage point of a spacecraft.  Each such measurement
    constrains the spacecraft to lie on the sight line in the
    direction $\bh{d}_k$ passing through the point $\bv{p}_k,$
    therefore measuring the directions to two or more stars constrains
    the spacecraft to lie at the point where all these lines
    intersect.</p>

  <p>In practice, the lines will all be skew, and we are faced with
    the more nebulous job of describing the position and shape of the
    region of space where the spacecraft must be located in order to
    be consistent with all our direction measurements.  Fig(3) hints
    at this problem with dotted lines on either side of the star sight
    lines showing the transverse displacements of the lines if our
    direction measurements had differed by $1''$ of arc.  In fact, the
    transverse displacement of each line in au is numerically equal to
    the distance to the corresponding star in pc!  We usually think of
    1&nbsp;pc as the distance of a star for which a 1&nbsp;au
    displacement of the observer changes its direction by $1''$, but
    for navigation problems, we think of it as the distance for which
    a $1''$ change in direction causes a 1&nbsp;au transverse
    displacement of the sight line.  A parsec is an au per arcsecond.
    Of course, our actual angular errors are not $1''$ - in fact,
    Fig.(3) shows we do much better - so the spacecraft must actually
    be in a region with dimensions scaled by the ratio of our actual
    angle errors to $1''.$</p>

    <figcaption><b>Figure 3.</b> The location of New Horizons on 2020
      April 23 as derived from the directions to Proxima Cen and Wolf
      359 measured from the spacecraft.  This is the view from the
      ecliptic north pole; the vertical axis is at zero right
      ascension and the origin is the solar system barycenter.  The
      line P passes through the precise GAIA 3-D location of Proxima
      Cen, in the direction measured from the spacecraft.  In other
      words, the LORRI image of Proxima Cen constrains the spacecraft
      to lie on line P. Similarly, the LORRI image of Wolf 359
      constrains the spacecraft to lie on line W.  The adjacent faint
      dotted lines show how much P and W would be displaced by a $1''$
      change in line direction; the transverse displacement in au is
      just the distance to the star in pc (1.30 for P, 2.41 for W).
      The trajectory NH is the actual path of the spacecraft from
      launch in 2006 through 2023, with ticks on January 1 each year.
      Notice that our actual angular errors must be much less than the
      $1''$ indicated by the dotted lines.  Proxima Cen is âˆ¼$45^\circ$
      south of the ecliptic, so line P tilts into the page at that
      angle; Wolf 359 and the NH trajectory are within $2^\circ$ of
      the ecliptic.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The dotted lines in Fig.(3) actually represent the standard
    deviation of cylindrical Gaussian probability clouds around the
    lines P and W.  Our measurements constrain the spacecraft to the
    ellipsoidal Gaussian probability cloud that is the product of the
    individual cylindrical distributions - the error ellipsoid to
    which our measurements constrain the spacecraft position.  You can
    see the projected shape of this error ellipsoid in the
    parallelogram where the dotted lines in Fig.(3) cross (scaled up
    in size as if our angular errors were $1''$) - just picture the
    ellipse inscribed in that parallelogram.  Given our measurements,
    the center of this error ellipsoid is the most likely position of
    our spacecraft, in other words our best guess at $\bv{x}$ given
    the directions we measured.  The shape and size of the ellipsoid
    are our estimate of the uncertainty in our determination of
    $\bv{x}.$</p>

  <p>If the actual spacecraft position is $\bv{x},$ then the actual
    direction to star $k$ is $(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k)/|\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k|.$
    (These are the GAA+JPL entries in Table 2.)  Let $\delta\alpha_k$
    be the angle between this and our measured direction $\bh{d}_k$ -
    our measurement error.  Writing $p_k$ for $|\bv{p}_k|,$ then since
    $\delta\alpha_k$ and $|\bv{x}|/p_k$ are both very small,
    \begin{equation*} \delta\alpha_k =
    |\bh{d}_k\cross(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k)|/p_k,
    \end{equation*}
    which we rewrite as
    \begin{equation} \delta\alpha_k^2 = \bigl(|\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k|^2 -
    (\bh{d}_k\cdot(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k))^2\bigr)/p_k^2.
    \label{eq:alpha2}\end{equation}
    If our measurements all have the same standard errors in angle,
    say $\sigma_\alpha,$ then each cylindrical Gaussian cloud will be
    $\exp(-\tfrac{1}{2}\delta\alpha_k^2/\sigma_\alpha^2),$ so the
    combined ellipsoidal cloud will be $\exp(-\tfrac{1}{2}\chi^2),$
    where
    \begin{equation} \chi^2 = \sum_k\delta\alpha_k^2/\sigma_\alpha^2.
    \label{eq:chi2}\end{equation}
    The center of this cloud is where $\chi^2$ is minimum, which is a
    perfectly well-defined point $\bv{x}$ even when the lines do not
    exactly meet (that is, when $\chi^2$ never reaches zero).</p>

  <p>What we are describing here is the well-known minimum chi-squared
    technique for finding the most likely parameters consistent with a
    set of measurements.  Here, $\chi^2$ is quadratic in $\bv{x},$ so
    setting its gradient to zero to find its minimum produces a simple
    $3\times 3$ system of linear equations for $\bv{x}.$  The gradient
    of Eq.(\ref{eq:alpha2}) is
    \begin{align*}
    \nabla\delta\alpha_k^2&= (2/p_k^2)\bigl((\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k)
                   - \bh{d}_k\bh{d}_k\cdot(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k)\bigr) \\
                 &= (2/p_k^2)\bv{Q}_k(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k),
    \end{align*}
    where we have defined $\bv{Q}_k=\bv{I}-\bh{d}_k\bh{d}_k^T$ as the
    $3\times 3$ matrix which projects vectors into the plane
    perpendicular to $\bh{d}_k.$  Setting $\nabla\chi^2=0$ and solving
    for $\bv{x}$ gives
    \begin{equation} \bv{x} =
        \BL^{-1}\sum_k\bv{Q}_k\bv{p}_k/p_k^2,
    \label{eq:x}\end{equation}
    where
    \begin{equation} \BL = \sum_k\bv{Q}_k/p_k^2.
    \label{eq:xlambda}\end{equation}
  </p>

  <p>Eq.(\ref{eq:alpha2}) looks simpler when expressed in matrix
    notation using the $\bv{Q}_k$ projection operator, so we can
    rewrite Eq.(\ref{eq:chi2}) as
    \begin{equation} \chi^2 = (1/\sigma_\alpha^2)
           \sum_k(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k)^T\bv{Q}_k(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_k)/p_k^2.
    \label{eq:chi2a}\end{equation}
    Now $\chi^2$ is just a quadratic in $\bv{x},$ and its second
    degree terms are proportional to
    $\bv{x}^T\bigl(\sum_k\bv{Q}_k/p_k^2\bigr)\bv{x},$ or $\bv{x}^T\BL
    \bv{x}.$ By construction, $\BL$ is a symmetric positive definite
    $3\times 3$ matrix, so its eigenvalues are positive and its
    eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis.  Since the ellipsoidal
    probability distribution for $\bv{x}$ is
    $\exp(-\tfrac{1}{2}\chi^2),$ those eigenvectors are the principal
    axes of the error ellipsoid, and the corresponding eigenvalues are
    the squares of its semi-axes.  Thus,
    \begin{equation} \bv{V}_\bv{x} = \sigma_\alpha^2\BL^{-1}
      = \sigma_\alpha^2\bigl(\sum_k\bv{Q}_k/p_k^2\bigr)^{-1}
    \label{eq:xcov}\end{equation}
    is the covariance matrix for for our most likely spacecraft
    position $\bv{x}$ given by Eq.(\ref{eq:x}).  Its eigenvalues (or
    singular values) are the squares of the principal axes of the
    error ellipsoid for the spacecraft position $\bv{x}$ calculated
    using Eq.($\ref{eq:x}$).  Note that if $p_k$ are in parsecs and
    $\sigma_\alpha$ is in arcseconds, then the units of
    $\bv{V}_\bv{x}$ will be au$^2.$ Eq.($\ref{eq:xcov}$) is a sort of
    matrix harmonic mean of the $p_k^2,$ with the $\bv{Q}_k$
    projection matrices providing weighting to account for the angles
    among the stars.</p>

  <p>Eq.($\ref{eq:x}$) matches the formulas given in Kaplan [2011],
    with the $1/p_k^2$ providing the weights for the terms in the sum.
    [More here.]</p>

  <p>To estimate the error $\sigma_\alpha$ in extracting the direction
    of a star from a particular LORRI image is not easy, and the error
    will certainly vary from image to image depending on the exact
    circumstances of spacecraft residual slew rates, exposure times,
    the background star field, and many other factors.  Many of these
    factors will not be known until after the image has been made, so
    for the purposes of planning a set of observations, a reasonable
    assumption is that the error in $\bh{d}_k$ is simply some angle
    $\sigma_\alpha$ on the sky.  For a star at distance $p_k$ (in pc)
    an error $\sigma_\alpha$ (in $''$) will cause the line determined
    by $\bh{d}_k$ and $\bv{p}_k$ to be displaced by
    $p_k\sigma_\alpha$.  For a single LORRI image, experience has
    shown us that $\sigma_\alpha$ is of order $0''\!\!.2$
    (1&nbsp;&micro;rad).  A single pixel is $4''\!\!.08$, so this
    amounts to 0.05 pixel.  Note that this is not a question of the
    resolution of the instrument, but of how well one statistic - the
    centroid - can be determined for something known to be a point
    source.  This is very much a ballpark estimate, within perhaps a
    factor of two or three.</p>

  <p>We have been ignoring any errors in the Gaia DR3 data for good
    reason.  Typical Gaia position errors are of order $0''\!\!.00003$
    at its baseline J2016.0 epoch, although errors in Gaia proper
    motions very rapidly degrade this accuracy over the 4.3&nbsp;yr
    interval to April 2020, at least for high proper motion stars like
    Proxima Cen and Wolf 359.  For them, the Gaia position errors have
    dropped to of order $0''\!\!.0003$ - but that is still a factor of
    a thousand less than $\sigma_\alpha.$ Gaia parallax errors are
    also of order $0''\!\!.00005,$ causing an uncertainty in $p_k$ of
    about 20&nbsp;au for Proxima Cen, and 80&nbsp;au for Wolf 359.
    These differences are projected transverse to the line of sight
    from the spacecraft by the same tiny angle of a few seconds of arc
    shown in Fig.(1) and Fig.(2), again causing a completely
    negligible uncertainty in the transverse displacement of line P or
    W in Fig.(3).</p>

  <p>Although the angular error in the direction measurement for a
    single LORRI image is of order $0''\!\!.2,$ we routinely reduce
    this error by averaging the measurements from several images of
    the same target.  In this case, we have a total of six images each
    of Proxima Cen and Wolf 359, which we believe reduces
    $\sigma_\alpha$ by a factor of $\sqrt{6},$ to a bit under
    $0''\!\!.1$ or 0.025 pixel.  Eventually, systematic errors and
    drifts will put a halt to this improvement, but for the case of
    LORRI, we are not sure what the best acheivable $\sigma_\alpha$
    might be.</p>

  <p>Although we have aggregated our six images of each star into a
    single direction measurement for the purposes of the plot in
    Fig.(4), we point out that Eq.($\ref{eq:x}$) and
    Eq.($\ref{eq:xcov}$) produce exactly the same values of both
    $\bv{x}$ and its covariance matrix (error ellipsoid)
    $\bv{V}_\bv{x}$ if you feed the directions of all twelve images
    into them, as if they were $N=12$ individual stars.  That is,
    $\bv{x}$ for this $N=12$ set of directions will be exactly the
    same as if you had used the mean $\bh{d}_k$ from the six images of
    the same star in an $N=2$ application of Eq.($\ref{eq:x}$).
    Similarly, an $N=12$ version of Eq.($\ref{eq:xcov}$) will produce
    the same error ellipsoid as the $N=2$ version with $\sigma_\alpha$
    reduced by $\sqrt{6}.$</p>

  <p>The size and shape of the error ellipse given by
    Eq.($\ref{eq:xcov}$) can also be used as a design tool to develop
    an observational program for locating a spacecraft.  Since the
    accuracy of the derived position is directly proportional to the
    distance of the star, only a few of the nearest stars are
    realistic candidates for this purpose.  Using
    Eq.($\ref{eq:xcov}$), you can rank all of the pairs of these
    navigation candidate stars by their performance in constraining
    spacecraft position.  To do this, you set $\bh{d}_k$ equal to
    $\bv{p}_k/p_k$ (a very good approximation), and do a singular
    value decomposition of the resulting
    $\bv{V}_\bv{x}/\sigma_\alpha^2$ matrix.  The square roots of the
    largest and smallest singular values are the shortest and longest
    axes of the error ellipse for a position determination based on
    the directions of that pair of stars.  The best pair for
    determining spacecraft positon will be the one with the smallest
    long axis.  If you put in the $p_k$ in units of pc, the error
    ellipse axis will be in au per arcsecond of $\sigma_\alpha.$
    Table 4x shows all five of the navigational candidate stars within
    3&nbsp;pc and the performance of all ten pairs of them.</p>

  <p>We originally thought that increasing the number of different
    stars would be important to improve the accuracy of a position
    determination based on observations of their directions.  However,
    Eq.($\ref{eq:xcov}$) tells a different story.  You can also use it
    to rank the relative performance of three or four or any number of
    stars according to the size of the error ellipse they produce.
    When we did this, we discovered that it is almost always better to
    repeat an image of a closer star that you have already used, than
    to add an image of a new more distant star.  This is certainly
    true of Proxima Cen and Wolf 359: If you want to improve the
    accuracy of $\bv{x}$ by choosing a third star to image, your very
    best option among all the stars in the sky is to repeat your
    direction measurement of Wolf 359.  The resulting reduction in the
    longest axis of your error ellipse will be better than any other
    star.  For navigation purposes, your optimal strategy is to choose
    the best pair you can, and image them over and over to beat down
    their effective $\sigma_\alpha.$</p>

  <h2>Section 3.2. The Derived Position of New Horizons</h2>

  <p>Fig.(4) shows in detail what happened when we applied this
    methodology to our Proxima Cen and Wolf 359 direction
    measurements.  On the left is a zoomed-in view of the same
    geomtery depicted in Fig.(3), viewed in the measured direction of
    Proxima Cen, so that the line P has been reduced to a point.  On
    the right is the analogous view at the same scale in the direction
    of Wolf 359, reducing the line W to a point.  These are the
    aggregated lines, so the directions $\bh{d}_k$ are the means of
    the directions measured in the six individual images of each star.
    The faint dotted circles and lines are at multiples of $0''\!\!.1$
    from the P and W lines; recall that our estimated $\sigma_\alpha$
    is a bit less than this at $0''\!\!.2/\sqrt{6}=0''\!\!.087.$ The
    star marks our best estimate of the spacecraft position $\bv{x}$
    from Eq.($\ref{eq:x}$).  The actual spacecraft position on April
    23, 2020 according to JPL is at the intersection of the two gray
    axes.  It is 0.350&nbsp;au away from the starred position derived
    from our LORRI images.  The solid ellipses are the 1-sigma and
    2-sigma error ellipses from Eq.($\ref{eq:xcov}$).  The actual
    position is near the 2-sigma error ellipse, which probably means
    that our assumed $0''\!\!.2$ error for a single LORRI image is too
    optimistic - it may be nearer 0.1 pixel than 0.05 pixel.</p>

  <figure>

    <figcaption><b>Figure 4.</b> Two zoomed views of the sight lines
      to Proxima Cen (P) and Wolf 359.  The left view is looking in
      the direction derived from LORRI images of Proxima Cen; the
      right view is looking in the direction derived from LORRI images
      of Wolf 359.  The NH line is the exact trajectory of New
      Horizons accordinag to JPL Horizons, with tick marks at 30 day
      intervals; the spacecraft is moving from right to left in both
      views.  The gray axes with ticks at 0.1 au intervals intersect
      at the position of NH on April 23, 2020.  The ticks on the
      trajectory before and after this point are April 5 and May 5,
      respectively.  The P and W lines are skew; the points of closest
      approach are connected by the dashed gray line, which lies in
      the plane of both drawings (ecliptic latitude is up in both
      views).  The lines are 0.133 au apart at closest approach.  The
      midpoint of the dashed connecting line is indicated by a gray
      dot.  The most likely spacecraft position $\bv{x}$ from
      Eq.(\ref{eq:x}) is indicated by the star.  It is 0.350 au from the
      true spacecraft position.  The faint dotted lines are nested
      cylinders around the P and W lines every $0''\!\!.1.$ The
      ellipses are the 1-sigma and 2-sigma error ellipses from
      Eq.(\ref{eq:xcov}) assuming $\sigma_\alpha=0''\!\!.2$ for each
      individual LORRI image.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>For the case of two lines, it is clear that the minimum $\chi^2$
    must occur on the shortest line segment connecting the two lines,
    which is the dashed gray line in Fig.(4): You could decrease the
    $\chi^2$ of any point off this line by zeroing its component
    perpendicular to the line.  This dashed line lies in the planes of
    both the left and right views; its direction is the cross product
    of the directions of the P and W lines.  The most likely point -
    the starred point - divides this connecting line into two parts
    with lengths in the ratio $p_1^2:p_2^2.$ Note that as the more
    distant star gets farther and farther away, the $\bv{x}$ from
    Eq.($\ref{eq:x}$) rapidly converges on the line determined by the
    nearer star; at the same time, the error ellipse from
    Eq.($\ref{eq:xcov}$) becomes more and more cigar shaped, aligned
    with the near star line.  This tendency is already evident in

  <h2>Data</h2>

  <p>The NH observations consist of a total of twelve images, six of
    Proxima Cen split into two "visits" of three 0.5 s exposures, and
    six of Wolf 359, also split into two visits of 5 s exposures.
    The three images within each visit are separated by only seconds.
    The total elapsed time is 27.65 hours, during which time the
    spacecraft moved 0.0093 au (nearly 1.4 million km at 14 km/s).</p>

  <p>Here are the raw data for $\bh{d}_k$, followed by the raw data for
    $\bv{p}_k.$</p>
